## Description

This is a Product preview card component challenge by Frontend Mentor, Frontend Mentor is a website that provides various web development challenges to help you develop your coding skills.

## Built with 

<p>HTML<p>
<p>CSS<p>
<p>Flexbox<p>

## What I learnt 
I didn't realise how much I struggled using images with flexbox, I spent way too much time trying to figure out why images were overflowing containers.
